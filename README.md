##  Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18.x or higher recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    If the project is hosted on GitHub, you can clone it using:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    cd your-repository-name
    ```
    Replace `https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or if you prefer Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set Up Environment Variables (if any):**
    This project uses Genkit, which might require API keys for AI models (e.g., Google AI Studio API Key for Gemini).
    *   Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project by copying the `.env` (if it exists and is empty) or `.env.example` (if provided).
    *   Add any required environment variables. For example, if you're using Google AI:
        ```env
        GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key_here
        ```
    *   Refer to the Genkit and Google AI documentation for details on obtaining API keys.

4.  **Run the Development Server:**
    Start the Next.js development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    or with Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```
    This will typically start the application on `http://localhost:9002` (as per your `package.json`).

5.  **Run the Genkit Development Server (for AI features):**
    Genkit flows run in a separate development server. Open a new terminal window/tab and run:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```
    or with Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn genkit:dev
    ```
    This usually starts the Genkit development environment, often on `http://localhost:4000`.

    You should now have both the Next.js frontend and the Genkit backend running.

## üìú Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

*   `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`: Runs the Next.js app in development mode with Turbopack.
*   `npm run genkit:dev` or `yarn genkit:dev`: Starts the Genkit development server for AI flows.
*   `npm run genkit:watch` or `yarn genkit:watch`: Starts the Genkit development server with watch mode.
*   `npm run build` or `yarn build`: Builds the Next.js app for production.
*   `npm run start` or `yarn start`: Starts the production Next.js server (after building).
*   `npm run lint` or `yarn lint`: Lints the project files using Next.js's built-in ESLint configuration.
*   `npm run typecheck` or `yarn typecheck`: Runs TypeScript type checking.

## ü§ñ AI Features (Genkit)

This application leverages Genkit to integrate AI capabilities. Key AI flows implemented include:

*   **`generateContextualInsights`:** (Located in `src/ai/flows/generate-contextual-insights.ts`)
    Provides AI-generated explanations and statistics for keywords found in the main text content. This is used for the hover-card insights.
*   **`generateTestimonialImageFlow`:** (Located in `src/ai/flows/generate-testimonial-image-flow.ts`)
    Generates avatar images for testimonials using an AI image generation model (Gemini 2.0 Flash experimental). (Note: Currently disabled in the UI for testimonials but the flow exists.)
